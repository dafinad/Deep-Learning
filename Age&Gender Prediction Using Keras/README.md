## Age and Gender Prediction Using Keras

The UTKFace dataset contains over 20,000 face images annotated with age, gender, and ethnicity. The project's objective is to detect gender and age from these facial images. 
A Convolutional Neural Network is used to classify the images, producing two outputs: gender (Male/Female) and age.
