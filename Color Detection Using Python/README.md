## Color Detection Using Python


Color detection is the process of identifying the name of any color by comparing the RGB values of the clicked point in an image to a predefined list of colors. 
This can be implemented using a CSV file that contains a list of color names and their corresponding RGB values. 
The application calculates the distance between the clicked color and each color in the data file to identify the name of the closest match.

## Libraries
* OpenCV: For image processing 
* Pandas: To handle the color data file.
